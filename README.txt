# Sentiment-analysis A project concerning the analysis of twitter tweet
to check the popularity of presidential candidates in the 2022 Kenyan
election This is done by the use of libraries such as textblob which is
used to check if a particular candidate is postively popular or not.
This information collected is then analysed using other libraries in
python such as python and Numpy and the end result is the graphed to
give the analysis of sentiments of the Kenyans on twitter concerning the
candidates who were running for presidency in the Kenyan August 9th
Election 2022. The main errors in the uploaded jupyter notebookk code is
due to the collected data containing names of the candidates but the
instance of use is not the required on e.g Ruto who is a presidential
candidate's name is also used in Asian countries to mean a different
thing thsu the loaction parameter is required when mining the data from
twitter. The data required has already been mined using the tweepy api
and is not available in the repository but can be availed in the future
when the requred code for the scaping twitter using tweepy is uploaded
The information provided is from the time duration of between February
and June 2022.
